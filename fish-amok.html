    <P>
        I won't lie, I was somewhat aprehensive as to what Cambodian cuisine could offer me as someone who's just come from Thailand.<br>
        Though I did find myself mostly eating western, vietnamese and thai food while there, one dish stood out amongst the rest.<br>
        It was a night after adventure in Battambang, in a quirky resturant that had their menu printed on recycled whisky bottles. <br>
        Though it didn't taste too different from yellow curry, I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.
