    <h1>Cookin with Jordz</h1>

    <div>
        <p>G'day Adlay's, today we'll be cooking up some of my favour dishes. A melting pot of Sydney / Gadigal Lands most iconic cultures.
        We'll be taking a look at the key ingredients it takes to cook up an authentic aussie bloke.
        We'll start be travelling all across Sydneys diverse and hazardous landscapes, sourcing the materials ourselves to make this dish that could only exist in such an isolated country.
        First, we'll sail into the eastern suburbs and make our way into the inner west before heading out to the far bounds of the western territory. Well? What the bloody hell are you waiting for?
