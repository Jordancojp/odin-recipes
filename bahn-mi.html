    <P>
        Hungover walking the streets of the mountainous hippy town Katoomba NSW, my mate was frothing a "Vietnamese Sandwich". <br>
        While I love sandwiches, I couldn't fathom how exactly the vietnamese had reinvented it for themselves. <br>
        This was the glorious moment I discovered a new life long love, the Bahn Mi. <br>
        Please note though it isn't traditional, my opinion is Bahn Mi's taste 10x better con queso.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pickling vegetables:</b> If you don't have store-bought pickled carrots and daikon radishes, you can make your own. Combine shredded carrots and daikon radishes with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Bread options:</b>While a French baguette is the classic choice for Bahn Mi, you can also use other types of bread, such as a hoagie roll or a ciabatta loaf.</li>
        <li><b>Con Queso:</b>Cheese it up brudduh, I'd go with some tasty or even mozzarella, don't you dare use sliced cheese.</li>
