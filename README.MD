I started TOP well over a year ago but never committed myself fully to completing it.

After 7 months of travelling I've decided that it's my dream to persue a career in web/app development.
I believe I have a broader understanding of getting things done and seeing things through, being able to finally dedicate myself to some hobbies that have been sitting in the backburner for a while.

This is my effort to jump back in and get something done.

Today I've retouched up on my knowledge of basic HTML syntax, using git within the terminal and seeing a project from start to finish.

Descriptions written by myself and the recipes were provided to me by AI as my main focus was to complete the project.
