    <P>
        I remember the first Pad Thai I'd ever had, it was with my first girlfriend after watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory. <br>
        My mother had recommended a resturant a few minutes walk.<br>
        Immediately I was blown away by the combination of tastes and textures and has since held a place as one of my all time favourite meals <br>
        You can absolutely ensure yourself in the 2 months I spent travelling Thailand, Pad Thai was a staple of my diet.
